  <h1>Homemade Japanese Curry</h1>
  <img src="images/jcurry.jpg" alt="">
  <hr>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p><em>
      Curry was brought to Japan by the British in the 18th century
      and has since become one of the nation’s most popular dishes.
      Unlike typical Asian curries, the Japanese sauce is thick and subtly
      sweet. As for the spice level, that can vary from mild to hot.
      "Curry rice" is commonly made using store-bought curry roux blocks.
      They are really good and convenient, especially in a pinch.
      But a from-scratch version doesn’t take that much more time or effort and
      tastes a bit fresher and more nuanced.
      You can also play with the flavorings to suit your taste.
      Onions, carrots and potato are classic curry rice ingredients,
      along with some kind of protein. This recipe uses beef,
      but you could try chicken, seafood or tofu,
      which can be cooked right in the sauce with the vegetables.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 pound beef chuck or rump, cut into 1-inch chunks and patted dry</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 large onion, cut into 1/2-inch wedges and layers separated</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 1/2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon garam masala </li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 heaping tablespoon ketchup</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch chunks (see Cook’s Note)</li>
    <li>1 large russet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
    <li>1/2 Fuji, Golden Delicious or Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and
      grated</li>
    <li>6 heaping cups steamed white rice</li>
    <li>[optional]Fukujinzuke (pickled vegetable relish) or
      beni shoga or kizami beni shoga (pickled red ginger), for serving</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat.
      Sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper.
      Add half the beef to the pot and cook until browned on at least 2 sides,
      about 6 minutes total.
      Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining beef,
      leaving it in the pot after it’s browned.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Add the beef from the plate and any accumulated juices back to the
      pot and cover with 6 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat.
      Reduce the heat and gently simmer, occasionally skimming off any scum
      and fat, until tender but not falling apart, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Transfer the cooked beef to a plate and set aside.
      Measure out 4 cups of the broth, leaving any sediment in the pot,
      and set aside. (If you don’t have enough broth,
      make up the difference with water.
      If you have extra broth,
      reserve it for thinning the curry later, if needed.)</li>
    <br>
    <li>Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over
      medium heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and sweat, stirring
      occasionally, until just softened, about 6 minutes.
      Add the ginger and garlic and cook,
      stirring often, for about 1 minute.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add the flour and cook, stirring often and breaking up any clumps
      of onion and flour, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
      Add the curry powder, garam masala and cayenne pepper and cook,
      stirring constantly, for about 1 minute.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Slowly whisk in the 4 cups reserved broth and whisk until smooth.
      Whisk in the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.
      Add the carrots, potatoes and grated apple and simmer,
      adjusting the heat as needed and stirring occasionally,
      until the vegetables are almost tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add the cooked beef and any accumulated juices and simmer,
      stirring often so the curry doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot,
      until the vegetables are completely tender, about 10 minutes more.
      Let sit for about 15 minutes for the flavors to meld.</li>
    <br>
    <li>If the curry looks too thick, thin with a little of the
      extra broth or water. Add salt and/or more cayenne, if needed</li>
    <br>
    <li>Serve in shallow bowls or deep plates alongside the white rice
      and fukujinzuke or beni shoga.</li>
